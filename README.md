**This is a simple portfolio tracker that can be used for cryptocurrency paper trading on Binance**

The script takes a .json file (see example) and plots daily PNL along total profit and loss. Can be used for deeper analysis of live trades on Binance as well as for tracking paper trades.
For more information on how to use this script see:  [Binance Paper Trading Tracker] (https://cryptomaton.org)

**Why?**
While Binance does offer a test net, you are not able to easily see the performance of your trades. In addition to that, the Binance testnet is rather limited and only allows a very limited amount of pairs.
This tracker will enable you to visualise the PNL of  your saved orders. You must store your trades in a json format as the one in the repo in order for this to work.
Even on the mainnet, Binance offers little in the way of tracking each of your trades performance.
